                                                *vinegar--*
-                       Open the parent directory of the current file.  This
                        is the only mapping available outside of netrw
                        buffers.

                                                *vinegar-~*
~                       Open $HOME.

                                                *vinegar-c_CTRL-R_CTRL-F*
                                                *vinegar-c_<C-R>_<C-F>*
CTRL-R CTRL-F           In command line mode, insert the path to the file
                        under the cursor.  Similar to the native
                        |c_CTRL-R_CTRL-F|, but resolves the path with respect
                        to the parent directory.

                                                *vinegar-.*
.                       Start a command line with the path to the file
                        under the cursor.  Provide a [count] to include
                        multiple files.

                                                *vinegar-!*
!                       As above, but use a |:!| command line.

                                                *vinegar-y.*
y.                      Yank the current line or [count] lines as absolute
                        paths.
